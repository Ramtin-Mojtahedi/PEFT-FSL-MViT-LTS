# Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Liver Tumor Segmentation

This repository contains the code, datasets, and results for the study titled **"Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning and Few-Shot Learning of Multiscale Vision Transformers for Liver Tumor Segmentation in Abdominal CT Scans"**. The project focuses on integrating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the Swin UNETR model to efficiently fine-tune large vision transformers for liver tumor segmentation using minimal data.

## Abstract

Liver tumor segmentation in abdominal CT scans is crucial for treatment planning and radiomics analysis. This study integrates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the Swin UNETR model to enable parameter-efficient fine-tuning with minimal annotated data. Through few-shot learning, the LoRA-enhanced model achieves high segmentation performance, balancing efficiency and accuracy. This repository provides the codebase, models, results, and instructions to reproduce the experiments.
